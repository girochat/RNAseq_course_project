# Script Directory
This directory contains all scripts used for the project. They are classified into subdirectories corresponding to each step of the workflow. The procedure to launch the different scripts and obtain the resulting files in the data and analysis directories can be found in the README.md file of each subdirectory.  
We have the steps :
* Step 1 - Qualitative and Quantitative analysis
* Step 2 - Alignment
* Step 3 - Transcriptome assembly
* Step 4 - Quantification
* Step 5 - Differential expression analysis
* Step 6 - Integrative analysis
* Step 7 - Prioritisation
